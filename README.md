INTRODUCTION.

 FarSwap is a decentralized cryptocurrency software built on the ethereum blockchain that enables a network of users to lend, borrow, buy and sell crypto assets and earn massive rewards. FarSwap is the pioneer decentralized platform that rewards both the lenders and the borrowers on the platform. 
The platform is both community-owned and community-run. 
Instead of using an order book, FarSwap utilizes automated market-making (AMM). In this model, liquidity providers add funds to the liquidity pool.
FarSwap has a unique native currency, FAR, which is issued to the liquidity providers on the FarSwap decentralized exchange. It has two functions. First, it entitles holders to governance rights hence they can participate in decision-making. Second, the coin entitles the holders to a portion of the fees paid to the protocol. In the FarSwap ecosystem, the FAR holders “own” the protocol.   
Community governance characterizes the decentralized finance (DeFi). The growth of liquidity mining (yield farming) as an acceptable method of token distribution in DeFi has led to many token launches. Yield farming levels the playing ground for everyone involved including those with no premines, or little to no founder allocation. It also ensures equal distribution of tokens based on the number of funds supplied.
The tokens distributed through liquidity incentives enable the users to participate in the governance role. Anyone with FAR tokens can Submit FarSwap an improvement proposal, which then the members can vote on with their tokens. The proposals may involve minor or even major changes to the protocol. Unlike the traditional teams such as Uniswap, FarSwap’s development is in the hands of the FAR token holders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Additionally, FAR holders get a portion of the fees that the traders pay into the protocol. FarSwap offers a strong community, which is a powerful asset for any token project, especially a DeFi protocol.
 
FARSWAP PARTNERSHIP WITH BINANCE 
  
FarSwap is actively working on Binance Smart Chain. 
Down below we will answer the question: Why does the FarSwap use the Binance Smart Chain contract?  
 
BSC is a better solution than Binance Chain in terms of function, speed, and versatility. It has interoperability features with new generation solutions such as passive income in the Defi world, it also stands out with the high transaction fees, intensive use of Ethereum, and the slow operation of the ETH 2.0 process. 
 
BSC offers high-speed transactions and lower fees with a 5 second block generation time. This means your FAR transfers are being confirmed rapidly. 
 
Here are the advantages which FAR gets from being on Binance Smart Chain :  
 
•	EVM compatibility (supporting software, applications, and software tools in Ethereum). 
•	A high-performance function that can generate one block every 3 seconds 
•	Supports Cross-chain Defi transfers 
•	The advantage of being supported by the Binance ecosystem 
•	Advanced security and safety 
 
FARSWAP PARTNERSHIP WITH NULS PROJECT. 
 
Here comes the partnership with the NULS project! 
 
In addition to ERC20; BEP20, FARSWAP is also using the NRC20 chain.  
 
Here are two chains that make FAR cooperate with NULS: 
NULS smart Contract and NERVE Cross-chain. 
 
Cross-chain consensus connects the NULS ecosystem with outside ecosystems and other blockchains for fluid circulation of information and assets. 
 
Right now You can stake #NULS and earn #FAR from as little as '100' NULS! 
 
In cooperation with NULLS NERVE, FarSwap will realize revolutionary goals in the world of DEFI. We are happy to announce this collaboration to you! 
 
FARSWAP and NFT  
 
  
"NFT"  "Non-Fungible Tokens", which you may have heard a lot in the news or on the internet recently, are products that you can replace with "Fungible-products". For example, if you have 1 kilogram of flour in your kitchen when this flour is exhausted, you can go to the market and buy another 1 kilogram, which is equivalent to it (not essentially different in "value"). But if you have Van Gogh's Auto-portrait in your house (or museum), it's impossible to replace it with a drawing identical to it in value if you have it stolen. There is 1 of that product in the world. The products that cannot be replaced at work are called "non-fungible" products in the sense of " unmatched". Of course, there is a gray zone between these two ends: If you have a Porsche 916, for example, you can technically fill it; however, only 11 of this car were ever built in the world, not to be reproduced, so it will be very difficult to replace your loss. As a result, the NFT culture, which is based on the purchase and sale of digital artworks with cryptocurrencies, deals with "non-commodities". So if you have 1 of them, you have a very unique product. 
 
Here FarSwap is going to assign the NFT platform for its users.  
Users will be able to buy/sell/bid on items and collections.  
As an example, it may be Domain Names, Virtual Worlds, Trading cards, Collectibles, Sports gifs, Utilities, etc. 
 
Can you see the revolution that this can create in the human culture? We are talking about valuing the originals of digital products found in every corner of the internet, such as "valuable, collectible items" of our childhood such as football player cards, Pokemon toys, or teasers! "First tweet", "first video", "most-watched TikTok" or any artist's digital works, games, academic or popular articles, and all other digital products you can think of can be bought and sold thanks to NFT and these will create a whole new market. 
 
In the beginning, FarSwap will offer two payment methods: ETH and FAR. 
To sell your goods you will be able to add them to the auction. And users who would like to purchase your goods will bid on them. 

How Farswap will drive the token economy?
- Users will buy the FAR token and convert it to an LP token to do farming. In this way, the token in circulation will decrease regularly.
- Tokens listed on our platform will buy and lock FAR tokens as much as their own. Considering that we will agree with many projects, FAR token circulation will be reduced again. For example; X project will open farming opportunity 10k USD worth of token on our platform. In return, it has to define the 10k USD worth of FAR token to our platform. This will increase the staking rate in the long run.
- Periodic buyback and coin burn program will reduce the circulation of the FAR token.
- In IFO sales, it will be necessary to have a certain amount of a FAR tokens to participate in or sell. As the token stake and holder ratio will increase continuously on our platform, which appeals to a wide range of users, the token economy will be reduced in a planned manner.
- 20% of FAR tokens purchased with Lottery will be burned
What benefits can you take advantage of and what you can earn on Farswap?
1- You can earn FAR tokens by farming with LP tokens you buy on the Farswap platform.
2- You can earn rewards from tokens in the pool by staking your FAR tokens. Each token has a different reward rate.
3- You can buy tickets in the lottery section and earn money from the lottery as a lucky person.
4- You can buy and sell NFTs on our platform and create your own NFT.
5- By gaining priority in IFO sales, you can invest in other projects upfront and gain more profit.
6- You can quickly trade with several tokens in the Exchange section.
7- You can benefit from the surprise awards that our platform will offer to users.
  
What is FAR Staking? 
 
 
FAR is a BEP-20 token issued to liquidity providers and on the FarSwap decentralized exchange. 
It is earned by providing liquidity to pools on FarSwap. 
You can earn at least 50% APY Staking FAR in the FAR Pool. 
Staking Far is quietly easy and requires connecting a wallet like Metamask; Binance Chain Wallet or Trust Wallet containing FAR and BSC (BNB) to pay for gas. 
 
FARSWAP and IFO  
 
Here we will disclose to you the "IFO", which is the business model of the coins that will be delivered on the FarSwap platform dependent on the Binance Smart Chain.  
 
We have seen various deal models in the cryptocurrency markets from the past to introduce. 
After models like ICO (Initial Coin Offering), IEO (Initial Exchange Offering), IDO (Initial Dex Offering), IFO (Initial Farm Offering), which FarSwap will begin to carry out as of late, will start to show up.  
 
Ordinarily, we need to satisfy certain conditions to take an interest in deals like ICO, IEO, for instance, to partake in IEOs made on the Binance trade, you need to hold BNB tokens inside a specific period and after this period, you are given tickets concerning the BNB you hang on a foreordained date. With these tickets, you participate in the lottery, if you are lucky, the lottery hits you and you get your tokens. 
IFO is a different model from all others, how about we look at it together.  
 
To take an interest in IFOs through FarSwap, when you give liquidity to the FAR-BNB pool, LP Tokens that are consequently shipped off you are shipped off you from the symbolic that is sold in kind for your LP Tokens. After the IFO closes, the token is generally opened straightforwardly on FarSwap and you can exchange.  
 
How would I give Liquidity to Participate in IFO? How might I join the IFO?  
 
To start with, we will require a wallet to work on FarSwap. Since FarSwap is a decentralized stage, we straightforwardly interface our wallet to the stage without opening a record. We can play out these exchanges with the Metamask wallet, however after the establishment of Metamask, it doesn't straightforwardly perceive the Binance Smart Chain, so we need to present it physically, in the accompanying article, we clarified bit by bit for the individuals who don't have the foggiest idea how to do this. 
 
  
Many alternatives with cross-chain. 
 
^ FarSwap is the first decentralized platform that gives rewards to lenders and borrowers on the platform. 
 
^FarSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (Dex) given by community vote. 
 
^FarSwap Lending and borrowing without KYC. 
FarSwap is a protocol that rewards participants extensively for their activities in an algorithm autonomous ecosystem without KYC. 
FarSwap distributes a 50% trading fee to Stakers and liquidity providers on the FarSwap platform. 
Earn a minimum of 55% APY, unstake anytime you wish.  
 
Incentives for liquidity providers. 
 
Uniswap makes it possible for liquidity providers to earn transaction fees from the fund pool when they actively provide liquidity. Once they withdraw funds from the pool, they will no longer receive that passive income. 
Besides, as agreements become more and more popular, even though they are early liquidity providers, they still face being joined by large funds, exchanges, mining pools, and other (larger and richer) stakeholders to join the agreement, which will the risk of earnings dilution. 
In FarSwap, liquidity is provided to the fund pool, and FAR tokens can also be rewarded. However, unlike Uniswap, even if you decide to no longer provide liquidity, the FAR tokens you get will also entitle you to continue to receive a portion of the fees in the FAR agreement. 
 
As an early miner involved in providing liquidity, you will become an important stakeholder in the agreement. The income you receive from your investment in the mining in the LP ( provides flow mobility) the number of tokens proportional to the total number of coins on behalf of the LP. Unless you continue to increase the provision of liquidity, your holdings and corresponding reward income will gradually be diluted as the capital pool grows. 
INCENTİVES FOR LENDERS AND BORROWERS 
Far lending and borrowing platform is developed and programmed for users to receive FAR tokens for reward anytime they lend or borrow cryptocurrency on the platform. users earn a 2 % additional bonus when they choose to pay back the loan with a FAR token. 
Users can stake the rewards they earn on FarSwap to earn more FAR tokens or exchange the FAR token to USDT. Users are required to lock a certain amount of FAR tokens before they can borrow funds on the platform. No KYC is needed for this operation. Lend and borrow with little or no fee in return. In addition to it, users can also borrow or lend any cryptocurrencies they want. 
 
We know that many of users are existing liquidity providers in the Uniswap pool. Based on this situation, we have designed a token distribution mechanism to make it as easy as possible for existing Uniswap liquidity providers to migrate to our agreement! 
To be able to start providing liquidity and obtain FAR tokens, anyone who holds Uniswap LP tokens can put these LP tokens in the corresponding initial pool list. Once this operation is completed, they will start earning token rewards after the block height of 287349823. The list of LP tokens can be added by way of governance voting on the chain. Therefore, this will be a decision made by each of us. 
In each block, 10 tokens will be created. These tokens will be evenly distributed to the miners in each fund pool. 
 
FAR MULTI CHAIN WALLET 
FAR is the first digital wallet to offer users a reward for sending and receiving tokens in the wallet. It is a dApp type wallet with a few multi-chain-like trust wallets. The FAR wallet has an atomic swap feature hence does not need an exchange to receive or send funds. The wallet enables users to hold FAR tokens on the wallet and be rewarded in FAR tokens. Users can also stake FAR tokens or other tokens on the FAR wallet and attract rewards. With this wallet, users can add a third party for a direct fiat purchase.  Users get a 0.1 token reward every 24 hours for tokens sent or received. The wallet attracts a very low gas fee (like TRON). The wallet also helps the users to track cryptocurrency prices. 
 
Reward distribution 
According to the current Uniswap configuration, 0.3% of all transaction fees in any pool will be distributed proportionally to the liquidity providers in the pool. 
In FarSwap, 0.35% goes directly to active liquidity providers, and the remaining 0.08% will be exchanged for FAR(obviously through FarSwap) and distributed to FAR token holders. 
 
Protocol Usage 
 
At the protocol and smart contract level, SushiSwap and FarSwap share the same interface. This means that if your protocol is currently compatible with Sushiswap, integration with FarSwap should be relatively simple. 
We will start integrating FarSwap with various Defi projects and other ecosystem tools.
